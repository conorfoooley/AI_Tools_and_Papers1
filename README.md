## GitHub Repos

Cool experiments and such

- https://github.com/Mattie/cataclysm - Metacoding (aka it figures out the function code just from the name of the function). Psuedocode straight into live code.
- https://github.com/KernAlan/ChroniclerAI - ChroniclerAI is a desktop application that records, transcribes, and summarizes audio using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model. The application is built in C# with XAML for the user interface.
